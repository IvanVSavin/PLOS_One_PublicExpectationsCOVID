# PLOS_One_PublicExpectationsCOVID
Data and code to reproduce results from the manuscript entitled "Public expectations about the impact of COVID-19 on climate action by citizens and government"

The R code titled COVID_STM_final.Rmd executes all steps of analysis from loading and cleaning the data to their analysis and visualization.

UABSES_195385_20200706.csv is the dataset itself, containing all survey responses collected in June 2020. Detailed explanation please find in the manuscript.

The remaining 6 files are supplementary materials:
1. vocabulary1_translated_corrected.csv and vocabulary2_translated_corrected are lists of most popular words in our topics (translated from Spanish to English) to generate wordclouds.
2. the other four R files are intermediate simulation resuls generated by the STM package to identify the optimal number of topics and find the final topic models.
